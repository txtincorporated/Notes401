### HEROKU & ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** set env vars, e.g. `APP_SECRET = 'mybigsecretvar'` or `PORT=3000` or `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://blahblahblah<hashoramarooneybingbangboom>`, with `env $(cat .env)`  
   * **ALSO NOTE:** for `env $(cat .env)` on Windows `require('log-env')` w/ a `log-env.js` file containing the lines `require('dotenv').load()` and `console.log(process.env)`
   * **ALSO ALSO NOTE:** that for setting a separate test .env var, in the test file you should `require('path')` and then `require('env.test').config({path: 'custom/path/to/test/vars'})` where you set the path inside the block
   * **ALSO SUPER EXTRA ALSO NOTE** that you should put any `.env` files in your `.gitignore` before pushing anywhere else
1. **NOTE ALSO** that for testing your shit without blowing up your db every time you can set `MONGODB_URI` to something other than your regular db  
  * **ALSO NOTE ALSO** that you should set this either in `package.json` or in a separate `.env` file but not in both
1. **NOTE:** specify node version for Heroku to use in `package.json` with `"engines": "node": "6.9.1"`


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **`env $(cat .env)`** catalogs all your env variables (Mac & Linux only)

#### GLORIA'S NOTES
Tuesday 11/8 – Heroku & Env Variables

local env variables

•	Add a .env file to the root of your project, and add it to the .gitignore
◦	it’s going to have any local configuration stuff OR secret variables you want to set
◦	ex/ API keys, your token secret phrase, where the DB is, what port to use, etc

•	.env file has key:value pairs of variable names and what you want to set them to
◦	syntax: KEY=VALUE
◦	VARIABLENAME=/path/to/thing
◦	MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/pirate
◦	APP_SECRET=sekritofthisapp

•	Setting env in linux systems can be done with:   env $(cat .env) node log-env.js

•	There’s also a npm module to handle this called dotenv
◦	this works for env variables when you’re on a team with Windows users 
◦	const path = require(‘path’);
◦	require(‘dotenv’).load({ path: path.join(__dirname, ‘env.test’) });
◦	this loads the env file into the js

•	In the server.js file:   require(‘dotenv’).load(); 
◦	looks for a .env file in your working directory
◦	it’s important to have this as the first line of the server 

From the dotenv docs:
require('dotenv').config();

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. 
Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE. 

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=s1mpl3

process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .envfile.

db.connect({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  username: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS
});



Heroku – env variables

•	In your Dashboard, under Settings tab, you can set variables in your Config vars
◦	it has key value pair input boxes
◦	Heroku always provides the PORT for you – you don’t set it
◦	you can set APP_SECRET for the tokens
◦	if you add mongodb to the project, it will automatically set the MONGODB_URI with the url location for you

•	You have to tell Heroku what version of Node you want in packages.json – the default is still 4.x
◦	“engines”: {      “npm”: “6.9.1” } 
•	Heroku apps will make a git repository for you, if you want to put it on top of an existing git repository, there are commands in the Heroku setup to link these together
