### PROTRACTOR TESTING

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** tests run in app column
1. **NOTE:** that `seleniumAddress` is optional if you want to tell it what `href` path to use; otherwise leave it blank and Selenium will make up its own mind about it
1. **NOTE:** that rather than load up Protractor `it` blocks with repetitive setup code it is possible to move all the setups into methods on a JS class in a second document, e.g., for `welcome.test.js`, `welcome-page.js`, then require the second into the first, allowing `it` blocks to contain only `expect` calls
  - **NOTE ALSO** that as you are in (pre-ES2015) Node land you must either use `module.export` and `require` for this, rather than `export default`, or incorporate babel with `require(babel/register)` in the `protractor.config.js`
1. **NOTE:** that `takeScreenshot` is particularly useful for capturing browser window at moment something fails

#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **Angular `filter`:**  tag property used after a `|` in an `ng-repeat`, requires conventional tag notation, i.e., `ng-repeat=$ctrl.blah | filter: {title: filter}`, not to be confused with `{{ <interpolation> | filter }}` in an interpolation binding
  * **`ng-repeat="blah in blah.blah | <pipe filters and everything else, then...> track by <property">`:**  tracks state of an array-like element as items are added/removed on the fly
