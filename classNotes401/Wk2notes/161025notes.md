# Code 401 10/25/16
## TCP E2E Notes

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **AHA!** Very important to separate the code tested from the test testing itself (e.g., `done()` callbacks not removing event listeners -- of course they don't!  They just cb to the `it` statement, not to the code it tests)
1. **NOTE** that the request method used for sending requests from the browser nav bar is always GET, though you can use, e.g., the Postman standalone Chrome app to change the method

#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **E2E TESTING** (a.k.a. integration testing): testing how all the parts of your app work together, as opposed to **UNIT TESTING**  just this or that part
  * **GOLDEN PATH:**  the most normative paths through an app, excluding edge cases and other exotics
  * **`socket.on(/*test body*/)` LISTENER VS. `socket.once(/*test body*/)`:** The latter fires an event listener only once; the former will leave it active and in a testing context it could interfere with subsequent tests that rely on listening for something other than what the first test sets 
  * **TEST CLEANUP:**  Setting `.done()` callbacks and `.end()` and `.close()` calls in the right places so that you don't wind up running an earlier test on a later test's parameters
  * **RESOURCE:**  Data path specified in url; the resource is the thing at the tip of the path but before any `?` query parameters
  * **URL QUERY:** Conditions set on the HTTP request in order to specify any search parameters placed on the request
  * **[HTTP VERBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods):**  
    * **`GET`** (and `HEAD`): requests a representation of a specific resource (`HEAD` calls for just the header info as opposed to the actual content body of the resource)
    * **`POST`:** requests to enclosed information to the identified resource
    * **`PUT`:** requests that enclosed information be stored under the [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI) given; pre-existing information at that URI will be over-written  
    * **`PATCH`:** requests modifications to a pre-existing resource
    * **`DELETE`:** requests that a resource be removed
    * **`OPTIONS`:** 
  * **[IDEMPOTENCY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning):**  In an operation, leaving the state of the value or resource operated on unchanged regardless of how many times the operation is called, e.g., the `GET` request method, which leaves the resource unchanged no matter how many times the request is placed, as opposed to the `DELETE` method, which obviously will change it quite radically on the first call
  * **REST USE CASES:**
    * `GET /todos/` = return the list of todos **(read)**
    * `GET /todos/:id` = return the list of todos (example: `/todos/123`) = return specific todo, often used for a detail view **(read)**
    * `POST /todos/` = create a new todo (and return object with id) **(create)**
    * `PUT /todos/:id` = create or replace todo with this specific id **(create/replace)**
    * `PATCH /todos/:id` = update the supplied properties on the todo with specific information **(update)**
    * `DELETE /todos/:id` = permanently remove the todo with this specific id **(delete)**
  * **HTTP STATUS CODES:**
    * **200:** OK
    * **300:** resource up-to-date
    * **400:** all 400s mean user error of some kind
    * **500:** server errors
