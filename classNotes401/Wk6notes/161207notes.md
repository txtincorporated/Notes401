### ANGULAR SERVICES

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that running a 3-tier architecture means you have to start three different processes every time you sit down to work -- in our case, Mongo, Express or what-have-you, and Webpack
1. **NOTE:** that once a project reaches any level of complexity you probably want to separate the server and the app into two repos and build from the latter into `public` in the server when getting ready to push up to deployment so that only the server actually ever runs in production and the app just runs on webpack-dev-server in your dev environment
1. **NOTE:** that `setTimeout()` has a default of zero but can still be wrapped around an `assert()` to make it wait for a promise-ified operation to resolve (also note that it actually does take about 5 ms)


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **3-tier architecture:**  Client, server & database
  * **`app.value()`:**  simplest form of a service; just returns a value without having to wrap it in a function call...
    ```javascript
      app.value( 'apiUrl', dev );

      // ...as opposed to...

      app.factory( 'apiUrl', function() {
        return dev;
      } );
    ```
  ...and can still be injected and passed around just like a service

  * **`provider()`:**  configures an Angular `service()`
  * **[`_$componentController_`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/service/$componentController):**  ...
