### THEMES IN PROJECT FEEDBACK

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **CLEAN CODE:** important to have consistent, clean code whether or not it's possible to find messy code out there in the wild from supposedly experienced programmers 
  - Try to be idiomatic and straightforward
  - All the more important when working on a team
  - Don't just hack eslint to get it to shut up
  - Don't leave piles of sawdust lying around
  - Only expose active code on the API
  - Use whitespace effectively
1. **REST ROUTES:** consistent and correct naming and definition important
  - Should describe resources, not queries, actions or options
  - Use of `/me` to indicate current user is handy, rather than exposing userId in URL
  - Route name reading comprehensibly as a sentence?
1. **SECURITY:** Some crucial points
  - Cannot trust user input
  - Have to bootstrap admin, e.g., do not let users self-appoint, facrissakes
    * Heroku has a hook that checks for admins and superusers and then creates on w/ predefined credentials if not found
    * NOTE:  You should always complain about having to touch the production environment!  You're a developer... until they make you kinda sorta ops
1. **PROMISES:** Some crucial points
  - Don't serialize what can be done in parallell
    * e.g., parent needs to be gotten byId, then children need to be populated onto parent with keys from parent; getting all the children can be done just fine in parallell, has no dependent relationship so can just be done in a `Promise.all()` rather than with `.then()`
1. **REFACTORING:** common probs
  - DRY it out!
  - Use model methods to clean up route code
  - Look for chances to eliminate repetition; repetitive code often an indication of need for design change
1. **TESTING:** a thinking activity
  - Avoid rote
  - ID core func and risks for testing
  - don't just check the same boxes over and over
