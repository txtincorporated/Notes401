### ANGULAR DIRECTIVES AND COMPONENTS

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that Angular services are all 'singletons' -- they are invoked only once per runtime and then accessed as needed by whatever needs them; pure JS logic
1. **NOTE:** that Angular directives are against the DOM
1. **NOTE:** that Angular components are now the ubiquitous standard in the industry
1. **NOTE:** that Angular component names are supposed to be hyphenated two-word combos by spec, though exceptions abound in the wild
1. **NOTE:** that if you don't use camelCase in your Angular component names they won't resolve correctly to kebab-cased tags in HTML
1. **NOTE:** that one of the best coolest things you can do with a directive is return an HTML template that binds directly to the attribute or tag 
1. **NOTE:** that array format keeps your shit from getting broke when you minify 
1. **NOTE:** that components are `bind to components: true` by default 
1. **NOTE:** that assigning `this` as `self` in order to preserve scopes is only necessary in ES5 where the assigned function creates a new scope; in ES2015 it's unnecessary if you use `() => {}`, which are contextless, instead of `function() {}`


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **Angular 'services':**  
    - `.factory()`:
    - `.service()`:
    - `.provider()`:
    - `.value()`:
    - `.constant()`:
  * **Angular 'directives':**  anything in template that 'directs' Angular to do something
  * **Angular `.component()`:**  new as of Angular 1.5; component names get put on the DOM template in kebab-case as if they were tags and the binding happens from there
  * **`.link()`:**  passes through, e.g., `$scope`, `element`, and `attrs` to a component element and tells the directive on which it is called what to do with them
  * **isolate scope notation:**  `scope: {}`
  * **[scope `attr` bindings](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile):**  
    - `@`: one-way from directive scope to parent, takes string
    - `=`: two-way
    - `<`: one-way from parent scope to directive
    - `&`: function binding
