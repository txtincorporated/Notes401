### JONAN SHEFFLER ON SALARY NEGOTIATION

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that you are worth more than you think you are
  - Pushing buttons is worth money
  - You can assume that your salary represents about half of what the company makes in profit off your work
  - If you didn't make them money, they wouldn't hire you
  - By the time you get to the interview stage they've already invested in you
1. **NOTE:** that companies often can't hire all the developers they need not because the people they are interviewing are unqualified but because of their poor interviewing process
1. **NOTE:** that the first person to name a number loses; if they say "how much were you making in your last position", you say anything except how much you were making in your last position or anything remotely related to it 
  - Try "I have an agreement with my former employer that I not discuss compensation with any third parties"...
1. **NOTE:** that you never dis your own show
  - If you once put a character in a `.js` file, you are a JavaScript developer
  - etc.
1. **NOTE:** that you absolutely must get off the phone the instant you hear an offer
  - Off!  Off!  Hang up!  Be grateful and polite, but hang up!
1. **NOTE:** that $15K is the negotiating sweet spot; add it to whatever is offered in your followup conversation after "talking to my [fill in significant other here]"
  - then they offer it in options
  - then you say you'll think about it
  - then you turn it back into cash
  - then (if they're not asshole you don't want to work for anyway) they come back with an adjustment
  - then you go nah
  - then they come back with their actual drop-dead
  - they you go, verbatim, "I would sign right now if we could add $7,000 to that"
  - then they go OK
  - and after that you never have to get hired this way again because it will all be through connections
1. **NOTE:** that you should hammer at your job for the first three months
  - go in 15 minutes early; don't leave 15 minutes late
1. **NOTE:** that 3rd party recruiters are not preferred for anything but contract employment

### JONAN ON DEV PIPELINE AT HEROKU

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that `push heroku master` is not really necessary with Heroku's GitHub tool activated; once you push to GH it will automatically update the review app, which can then be forwarded to Heroku staging in the browser console and thence to Heroku production the same way 


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **[exercism.io](http://exercism.io):**  code challenges
  * **[adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com):**  code challenges
  * **[projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net):**  math code challenges
  * **[rosalind.info](http://projecteuler.net):**  code challenges
  * **[think-like-a-git.net](http://think-like-a-git.net/):**  learn git
  * **three environments:**  
    - dev: e.g., a feature branch in git; using TDD as intended, start with a failing test and then write the absolute mimimum code to make it pass, then A-C-P to GitHub, then change the test up so it fails again but describes what you actually wanted in the last test, etc. 
    - staging: e.g., a dev branch in git; test drive what you intend to put into production; s.b. identical 
    - production: e.g., master in git, pushed directly to production (e.g., heroku-master); showtime
  * **CI/CD:** continuous integration/continuous deployment (or delivery) 
  * **Tim Pope:** Google tim pope blog
