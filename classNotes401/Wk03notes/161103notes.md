## Notes MODEL RELATIONSHIPS

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** That one thing Mongo can do that SQL can't is accept arrays as properties
1. **WHAT** is the difference between `query` and `find`?


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **ONE TO ONE** Anyject
  * **ONE TO MANY** Anyuct
  * **MANY TO MANY** Abect
  * **NON-FLAT DATA** e.g., a 2-dimensional property (array as property)
  * **FOREIGN KEY:** Key accessed by a model by reference to another model that already has it
  * **DESTRUCTURING:**
    ```javascript
      function fn(someObj, array) {
        //const name = someObj.name;
        const {name} = somObj;

        //const first =[0];
        //const second =[1];
        const first,
              second = [1, 2];
      }
    ```
  * **`.lean()`:** query option that returns just the values for the key specified without getting the entire Model object, useful in cases  where validation is not needed and performance is at stake
  * **STATICS:** functions that adapt built-in methods on a model, e.g. `find`, to specific purposes, applicable to all instances of that Model:
    ```javascript

    schema.statics.findByWeapon = function(weaponName) {
        return this.find({'weapons.name': weaponName});
    }
    ```
