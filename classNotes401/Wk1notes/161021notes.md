### HOW TO WHITEBOARD INTERVIEW
#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **DO PREPARE:** avoid choking
1. **RELAX!**  all the standard interviewing rules of thumb apply -- the show must go on, never dis your own production, etc.
1. **ASK GOOD QUESTIONS,** e.g., can I assume valid inputs?
1. **THINK ALOUD!**
1. **WORK AT A RELAXED, NATURAL PACE**
1. **CODE IDIOMATICALLY,** and don't, e.g., pseudo-code or 'circumlocute'


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **IDIOMATIC:** exhibiting the style or approach that would commonly be expected, not just whatever works,


### ARRAYS
#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **OBJECTIVE:** given an array, test it for duplicates 
  * return `false` if no duplicates, return `true` if at least one
1. **OBJECTIVE:** given an sentence, return an object that has a property for each word whose value is the count of that word in the sentence 
  * SENTENCE:  The big cat loves the little cat
  * OUTPUT:  {'The':1, big:2, cat:}
1. **OBJECTIVE:** implement `.push()` on an array only using length and index numbers  
  * **THE QUESTION:**  What is the big O complexity of your task?
1. **OBJECTIVE:** implement `.unshit()` on an array only using length and index numbers  
  * **THE QUESTION:**  What is the big O complexity of your task?


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **ALGORITHMIC ANALYSIS:** determining the resources required for a piece of code to run
  * **INPUT SIZE:**  size of, e.g., an array or object 
  * **SPACE COMPLEXITY:**  mem./disk space req'd., as a function of input size, importatn to keep an eye on when working in Node.js, where millions and millions of users could be accessing a given operation at once
  * **BIG O COMPLEXITY CHART:**  graph of increasing complexity as function of value size where, e.g....
    * O(1): constant
    * O(n): linear, as in indexOf an array or a single-level for-loop
    * O(n^2): quadratic, grows proportionate to input size multiplied by itself, e.g., single-nested for-loop
    * O(2^n): 'shit gets real, real quick'
    * O(log n):
