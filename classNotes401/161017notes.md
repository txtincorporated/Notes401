# Code 401 10/17/16
## Notes

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE** that JS is a *single-threaded* language, meaning that you never have to worry about concurrency issues; it is 'thread-safe'.
1. **NOTE** that even Node will choke out if you start making it do computationally expensive stuff, as computational processes cannot be run asynchronously.


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **PROCESS:** The structure for allocating CPU time and memory resources to a program
  * **THREAD:** The structure for allocating CPU time within a process
  * **THREAD POOL:**  List of all threads needing allocation within a process
  * **V8:**  The Chrome JavaScript engine, adapted in Node.js for use outside the browser
  * **CONCURRENCY:**  Multiple threads attempting to access the same variable at about the same time
  * **EVENT LOOP:**  Circulation pattern between the active queue and ansynchronous calls that have yet to complete during run-time
  * **INTERFACE,** as in Application Programming Interface (API):  input interface = means of passing input to the function/program; output interface = the well-formed, required output of the program
  * **(10/17/16) STACK:**  stores primitive values, incl. references to, e.g., objects, etc.
