### PROJECT BOILERPLATE REVIEW

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that it's kind of standard practice to call your entry point on a node project `main.js`
1. **NOTE:** that you can put your babel config either in your `karma.conf.js`, in a .babelrc or in `package.json`
1. **NOTE:** that on a dual-package project your boilerplate `.eslintrc` can go at the root level and then you can have project-specific versions in the app and server directories


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **globals:**  config settings files that are used across test runs, such as start
  * **file directive:**  eslint directive included in a comment at the top of a file telling eslint to ignore some class of defined irregularities in that particular file, e.g. `/* globals angular, chai */`
  * **line directive:**  eslint directive included in a comment at the end of a line telling eslint to ignore some class of defined irregularity on that particular line, e.g., `// eslint-ignore-line no-unused-vars`

### SASS/SCSS

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that people often say SASS when they actually mean SCSS
  - SASS: syntactically significant white space, no bracketing or semicolons, more Java-like
  - SCSS: superset of CSS syntax and punctuation (so CSS is valid SCSS)
1. **ALTERNATIVES:** SMACCS; BEM; Atomic
  - SASS/SCSS increasingly preferred, so we're using that 
  - all of the above somewhat obsolete if "scoping" used in upcoming version of CSS
1. **NOTE:** that no Ruby gem install nec.; you can just use `npm i`
1. **NOTE:** that css extract-text plugin no longer needed for webpack unless using Angular material design
  - Just need to switch back to the old `style-loader?sourcemap!css-loader?sourcemap!sass-loader?sourcemap` syntax with `?sourcemap` after each
  - Must make sure to use `.scss` file extension on, e.g., `./main.css` --> `./main.scss`
1. **NOTE** that for selector extensions (i.e., not descendant selectors) `&:` is the prefix, e.g,
  ```css
    button {
      color: blue;
      background-color: white;

      &:hover {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    }
  ```
1. **NOTE** that Angular css requires a master class to be set on a single top-level element, e.g., `ng-class="$ctrl.styles.pirate"` in order to scope styles properly using, e.g., `:local(.pirate) {}`
1. **NOTE** that SCSS partials don't need to be pulled into the webpack build; css-loader will skip any file prefixed with an `_` as a partial 
  - will be pulled in with `@import` in main file
  - helps avoid git merge conflicts with multiple devs working on one big file at the same time
1. **NOTE** that `_partials` have to be brought in with `@import`, whereas `@mixins` can be defined inline but if not must be brought in with `@include` inline (and, if defined in a `_partial`, brought in with `@import` as usual)


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **SASS:**  Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
  * **SCSS:**  Sassy CSS
  * **partial:**  SCSS that does not function on its own but can be imported into multiple other SCSS files
  * **mixin:**  SCSS that can be defined once and then re-used in multiple stylesheets
