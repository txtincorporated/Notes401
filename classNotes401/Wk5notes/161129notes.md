## Notes 11/29/16
### WEBPACK

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that we're moving into an area where what you write is not what actually gets run
  * heavy transpiling and other processing en route to runtime for compatibility, compression, etc.
  * may wind up with just a single file getting served out to the client
1. **ENSURE:** that anything you want to go into your Webpack bundling pipeline gets put into it own little directory called, e.g., `src`
1. **NOTE:** that module systems generally cache resources in memory rather than writing them to storage or re-exporting them for each call
1. **NOTE:** that with Webpack type systems as long as you remember to include your `require` statements you can just blithely add JS files whenever you want and the only `<script>` tag you ever need is still just bundle.js; Webpack pulls everything into that one file 
1. **NOTE:** preLoader (mainly to make sure things have been properly linted): test, loader, exclude :
  ```javascript
  module: {
    preLoaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/
      loader: 'eslint-loader'
      exclude: /node_modules/
    }]
  }
  ```
1. **NOTE:** `webpack-dev-server --inline` to get rid of the stupid frame
1. **NOTE:** that the babel-core loader doesn't do a hell of a lot on its own; need to also install, e.g., babel-es2015 preset


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **App server (AS) vs. "server server" (SS):**  former serves static assets like HTML, CSS, JS and media, while the latter serves API data in JSON form
    * **Values are** 
      - cycle time, debugging, logging for AS, stability, compressibility for SS
  * **[Abstract Syntax Tree](https://astexplorer.net) (AST):**  parses textual representations of code according to statement typology in order to, e.g., go into the metadata for each statement's dependencies and produce a modularized version
  * **plugins:**  pull in dependencies that we can't don't want to have to include in our `require` statements, in order to bring along stuff that isn't in bundle.js like, for example, index.html or, with extract-text, set up a separate bundle.css or some such that sits alongside bundle.js, etc.
    * also puts in `<script>` tag automatically for any extra included files
  * **loaders:**  allow you to bring in things like CSS that you wouldn't normally be able to require, as in `const css = require('./main.css');`
    * allows, e.g., css to be put in its own bundle.css or what-have-you so that you don't get the FOUC while your client is parsing css strings out of bundle.js to put on the DOM directly
    * **NOTE** that bang (`!`) means that you're passing it multiple loaders that should hand off to one another, so `style!css` means that `style-loader` hands off to `css-loader`
  * **sourcemaps:**  systematically track correspondence between source files and bundled code for debugging purposes so that we don't have to deal with giant bundle files in the console.
