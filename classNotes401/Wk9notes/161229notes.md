### SOCKET.IO

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that real time distributed data (e.g., Google Docs) requires more than a request/response architecture for server communications
1. **NOTE:** that most event naming is arbitrary in socket.io, so for example 

  ```javascript
    socket.on( 'message', message => {
      socket.broadcast.emit( 'message', message );
    } );
  ```
  could just as easily read 

  ```javascript
    socket.on( 'bob', message => {
      socket.broadcast.emit( 'bob', message );
    } );
  ```
  **BUT ALSO NOTE** that some event names do have meaning, e.g., `connection` or `disconnect`


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **[socket.IO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket.IO):**  JS library for bidirectional communication between servers and clients over http
    - do `http.createServer` and pass it into socket.io
    - allows 'true push', in which the server is allowed to initiate the communication
  * **[long polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling):**  client makes a request to the server and then keeps socket open while awaiting a response; hack devised to emulate true server push communication
  * **`emit` vs `broadcast.emit`:**  plain old `emit` emits an event to all and sundry; `broadcast.emit` sends event to everyone but the sender
  * **`socket`:**  plander

### JOB SEARCH

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that in Jordana's experience CF grads generally do better with a targeted search but a mixed strategy is probably best
  - high volume can get you lots of interviews, keep you sharp
  - targeted can get you connected with a more warmed up audience
1. **CHECKLIST:** 
  1. LinkedIn
  1. List of target employers
    - top-ten lists and other press
    - personal recommendations
  1. Research target lists
    - Google
    - LinkedIn 
    - GlassDoor 
    - personal accounts 
    - Code Fellows grads
    - What is their tech stack?  Do you know it?
  1. Back to LinkedIn: check out and vet your connections within selected target companies
    - introductions
    - cold-contact:  choose someone you "feel like" contacting, then make the ask via a coffee invite ('I'd love to meet you, hear about your career path and how you find New Relic')
    - business hours O.K.; 15 - 20 min. at their office is also good; if they don't respond at first it doesn't necessarily mean they're ignoring you; give them another couple of tries and you'll be surprised at how often they're apologetic for not having resonded and perfectly willing to meet 
  1. Meetup 
    - search JavaScript, your favorite library or framework, etc.
    - Calagator: three or four events every night 
    - Macs List 
    - PDX Startups Switchboard
    - New Relic Future Talks
    - Portland Women in Tech (men go too, but check first) 
    - New Tech PDX -- good format, plus sponsor tables
    - Agile PDX 
    - OK to lurk!
    - Hello World devs -- often has interim contract work 


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **high volume vs targeted:**  networking, info interviews, etc. vs. mass applications
