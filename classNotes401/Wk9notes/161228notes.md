### OAUTH

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that OAuth can provides not only 3d party authentication support but integration with the 3d party app as well, so that, for example, users can post to, e.g., Twitter or Facebook directly from your app


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **OAuth:**  service for using third party authentication for user access, say, by accepting their Twitter credentials in place of setting them up with your own
  * **`$authProvider`:**  setting in `app.config()` that provides OAuth services
  * **`satellizer`:**  3d party Angular module that integrates, e.g., twitter sign-in; does the heavy lifting of OAuth integration
  * **`etc/hosts`:**  your root-level env file for resolving host domains such as, for example, `localhost` to 127.0.0.1; requires root access to edit, of course
  * **`request`:**  popular third-party library for talking to external APIs via REST
