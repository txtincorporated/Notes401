### AUTHORIZATION

#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE:** that security is on the server; if not, it doesn't really matter how it's implemented on the client
1. **NOTE:** services needed:
  - user-service (talks to the token service, then passes along the token verification to the server; also handles queries from `$stateChangeStart`)
  - token service (talks to local storage)
1. **NOTE:** Angular ui-router state events have to be imported until such time as they get done new `$stateChanged`
1. **NOTE:** that using `$inject` you can only inject services
1. **NOTE:** that `ngAuth` provides only `template` as opposed to the rest of Angular which distinguishes it from `templateUrl` for purposes of distinguishing in-line templates in the controller from template file referencs; to set it as one or the other use `plain: true`/`plain: false` for inline strings and file refs respectively


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **`$window`:**  Angular's implementation of the `window` object, e.g., `$window.localStorage.getItem(TOKEN_NAME)`
    - **NOTE** that `getItem` is built into JS `localStorage`
  * **state change event:** time to check for unauthed if router state requires Auth; need scheme for detecting route states
    - useful for sending users on to requested pg. when signin req'd in response to their orig. request
  * **`ng-dialog`:**  Angular's implementation of lightbox overlays for dialogs
  * **Http Interceptor:**  fully injectable function that sends token in request header and redirects away from error states back to, e.g., your 'landing page' state
  * **O-Auth:**  security scheme for delegating authorization from a given web site to, say, twitter or facebook (i.e., "Sign in with Facebook")
