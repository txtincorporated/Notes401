### [Book 3, `this` and Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes)
#### [Chapter 1:  `this` or That?](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch1.md)
#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
  1. **`this` VS. `context`:** There's this thing called `context` which `this` in many cases delivers us from.  Who knew?  Importantly, this (by which I mean`this`) is particularly relevant when working with APIs.
    * So what the hell is context?
  1. **GREAT ILLUSTRATION OF `this` ARGS:** 
  ```javascript
    function foo(num) {
      console.log( "foo: " + num );

      // keep track of how many times `foo` is called
      // Note: `this` IS actually `foo` now, based on
      // how `foo` is called (see below)
      this.count++;
      }

      foo.count = 0;

      var i;

      for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
          if (i > 5) {
              // using `call(..)`, we ensure the `this`
              // points at the function object (`foo`) itself
              foo.call( foo, i );
          }
      }
      // foo: 6
      // foo: 7
      // foo: 8
      // foo: 9

      // how many times was `foo` called?
      console.log( foo.count ); // 4
  ```
  Here is the `.call()` method in action, binding the `this` value of a function by taking the function name as its *`thisArg`*

    > Every time you feel yourself trying to mix lexical scope look-ups with `this`, remind yourself: *there is no bridge*.

#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **`this`:**  
  > `this` is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and what it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called.
  * **CONTEXT:**  [the object, array or function to which a given reference points at a given point in the code?]
  * **CALL-SITE:**  the line in your code where a function is called
