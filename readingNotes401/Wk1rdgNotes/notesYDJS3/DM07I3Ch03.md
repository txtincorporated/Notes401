### [Book 3, `this` and Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes)
#### [Chapter 3:  Objects](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch3.md)
#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS?**
   ```javascript
   var myObject = {};
   .
   .
   .
   myObject[myObject] = 'baz';

   .
   .
   .
   myObject['[object Object]']; //'baz'   
   ```

1. **RE. PROPERTIES OF ARRAYS:**  If adding a property to an array doesn't change the length but in, e.g., the example given...
   ```javascript
   var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];

   myArray.baz = "baz";

   myArray.length; // 3

   myArray.baz;    // "baz"
   ```
   ...since `console.log(myArray);` nonetheless returns `["foo", 42, "bar", baz: "baz"]`, then what the heck is `baz`?  Does this mean that `0`, `1` and `2` are all properties like `baz`, in addition to being array indices, and that when you get `array.length` you're just getting the number of 'indexical' properties?

1. **[`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, property)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor):**  Who knew that properties had properties!
1. **[`Object.defineProperty(object, property, {descriptor})`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty):**  Woot!
1. **`enumerable: false`:**  Is this why array properties other than indices don't show up in `array.length`?
1. **NOTE** that to make an obj truly immutable you'd have to freeze/seal not only the obj itself but any objs (i.e., functions, arrays, etc.) it references
1. **RE. USING GETTERS & SETTERS TO OVERRIDE ACTUAL PROPERTY VALUES:**  What are some reasons we'd want to do this?  The examples seem totally bizarre.


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **SHALLOW vs. DEEP COPIES:**  in this case, shallow copy duplicates object references on the source but not the objects themselves, whereas a deep copy would duplicate the objects themselves, including any functions involved
    * **[`Object.assign(target, ...sources)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign):** makes a shallow copy of a source object or objects 
  * **[`Object.preventExtensions(object)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/preventExtensions):**  prevents properties or methods from being added
  * **[`Object.seal(object)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal):** performs preventExtensions and makes all properties `configurable: false`
  * **[`Object.freeze(object)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze):** ups the ante from seal by making all 'data accessor' properties `writable: false`
  * **`in` vs. `hasOwnProperty()`:** `(a in myObj)` will keep looking up the [[Prototype]] chain for `a` if it doesn't find it in `myObj`; the other one will not
