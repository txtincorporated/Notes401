#### QUESTIONS & COMMENTS
1. **NOTE** that JS does not have classes properly speaking in the sense of strictly OO languages, but that it does allow for going to extraordinary lengths to approximate them


#### TERMS & CONCEPTS
  * **INSTANTIATION:** Creating a new instance of a class, usually with the operator `new`
  * **INHERITANCE:**  In the case of a child class, duplicating the properties and methods of the source class while potentially changing their values and adding new ones
  * **RELATIVE POLYMORPHISM:**  The ability of a child member of a class to alter ('override') the constructors, methods and properties of the parent class
  * **`super` (a.k.a. `inherited`):**  Keyword referencing a property or behavior to be inherited from an antecedent class in the hierarchy
  * **'EXPLICIT PSEUDO-POLYMORPHISM':**  JavaScript's improvised way to mimic polymorphism found in OO languages, e.g., `Vehicle.drive.call( this );` in the example; big no-no if you can avoid it, as it makes code more brittle and harder to maintain in JS due to the fact that inheritance works via reference-copying rather than value-copying
